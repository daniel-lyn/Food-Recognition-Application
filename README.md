# Food Recognition Application for Andriod Phone

In this project, a mobile application will be developed for people to know more about their diet. 

People both having packed lunch and having lunch at a restaurant can use this application as there will be mainly two parts of the application including food recognition and restaurants recommendation. 

The food recognition will be introduced in the application especially for people who have packed lunch. 

They can know the nutrition facts of the food they are going to bring, and to make adjustments accordingly. 

The restaurant recommendation will be convenient for people who need to have lunch at restaurants. 

People who need to work may only have a short period of lunch time. 

The application will show the menus of different restaurants nearby in order to help you choose the most suitable one for you to have a healthier diet. 

Convenience and uniqueness of this application is improved in this project when compared to other applications in the market.
